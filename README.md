**Resistor Color Coding in Python**
This Python program uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to help you decode the color bands on a resistor and determine its resistance value. Resistor color coding is a standard way of representing resistor values, and this tool simplifies the process of finding the resistance value based on the color bands.

**Installation**
To use this tool, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from python.org.
**Usage**
The program prompts you to enter the colors of the resistor bands, starting from the left. It will then calculate and display the resistance value in ohms.
The color codes for the resistor bands are as follows:
->Black: 0
->Brown: 1
->Red: 2
->Orange: 3
->Yellow: 4
->Green: 5
->Blue: 6
->Violet: 7
->Gray: 8
->White: 9
You should input the colors as a single string, with each color separated by a space. For example, if your resistor has the colors "Red Green Brown," you should enter "Red Green Brown" when prompted.
**Example**
Let's say you have a resistor with the colors "Yellow Violet Red." Running the program would look like this:
**Enter the colors of the resistor bands (separated by spaces): Yellow Violet Red
Resistor Value: 4700 ohms
